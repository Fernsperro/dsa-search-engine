Return any one split in which the maximum difference between any two numbers is minimized . You may return the result in any order . &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 100, k = 2 Output: [10,10] Explanation: The split [10, 10] yields 10 * 10 = 100 and a max-min difference of 0, which is minimal. Example 2: Input: n = 44, k = 3 Output: [2,2,11] Explanation: Split [1, 1, 44] yields a difference of 43 Split [1, 2, 22] yields a difference of 21 Split [1, 4, 11] yields a difference of 10 Split [2, 2, 11] yields a difference of 9 Therefore, [2, 2, 11] is the optimal split with the smallest difference 9. &nbsp; Constraints: 4 &lt;= n &lt;= 10 5 2 &lt;= k &lt;= 5 k is strictly less than the total number of positive divisors of n .",

A robot starts at the top-left corner of the grid (0, 0) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1) . It can move only right or down . If the robot attempts to move into a mirror cell, it is reflected before entering that cell: If it tries to move right into a mirror, it is turned down and moved into the cell directly below the mirror. If it tries to move down into a mirror, it is turned right and moved into the cell directly to the right of the mirror. If this reflection would cause the robot to move outside the grid boundaries, the path is considered invalid and should not be counted. Return the number of unique valid paths from (0, 0) to (m - 1, n - 1) . Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . Note : If a reflection moves the robot into a mirror cell, the robot is immediately reflected again based on the direction it used to enter that mirror: if it entered while moving right, it will be turned down; if it entered while moving down, it will be turned right.

For any positive integer x , define the following sequence: p 0 = x p i+1 = popcount(p i ) for all i &gt;= 0 , where popcount(y) is the number of set bits (1&#39;s) in the binary representation of y . This sequence will eventually reach the value 1. The popcount-depth of x is defined as the smallest integer d &gt;= 0 such that p d = 1 . For example, if x = 7 (binary representation &quot;111&quot; ). Then, the sequence is: 7 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1 , so the popcount-depth of 7 is 3. Your task is to determine the number of integers in the range [1, n] whose popcount-depth is exactly equal to k .

    "description": "You are given an integer array nums and an integer maxC . A subarray is called stable if the highest common factor (HCF) of all its elements is greater than or equal to 2. The stability factor of an array is defined as the length of its longest stable subarray. You may modify at most maxC elements of the array to any integer. Return the minimum possible stability factor of the array after at most maxC modifications. If no stable subarray remains, return 0. Note: The highest common factor (HCF) of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements. A subarray of length 1 is stable if its only element is greater than or equal to 2, since HCF([x]) = x . &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [3,5,10], maxC = 1 Output: 1 Explanation: The stable subarray [5, 10] has HCF = 5 , which has a stability factor of 2. Since maxC = 1 , one optimal strategy is to change nums[1] to 7 , resulting in nums = [3, 7, 10] . Now, no subarray of length greater than 1 has HCF &gt;= 2 . Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 1. Example 2: Input: nums = [2,6,8], maxC = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: The subarray [2, 6, 8] has HCF = 2 , which has a stability factor of 3. Since maxC = 2 , one optimal strategy is to change nums[1] to 3 and nums[2] to 5, resulting in nums = [2, 3, 5] . Now, no subarray of length greater than 1 has HCF &gt;= 2 . Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 1. Example 3: Input: nums = [2,4,9,6], maxC = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: The stable subarrays are: [2, 4] with HCF = 2 and stability factor of 2. [9, 6] with HCF = 3 and stability factor of 2. Since maxC = 1 , the stability factor of 2 cannot be reduced due to two separate stable subarrays.

    "description": "You are given a directed acyclic graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n &minus; 1 . This is represented by a 2D array edges of length m , where edges[i] = [u i , v i , cost i ] indicates a one‑way communication from node u i to node v i with a recovery cost of cost i . Some nodes may be offline. You are given a boolean array online where online[i] = true means node i is online. Nodes 0 and n &minus; 1 are always online. A path from 0 to n &minus; 1 is valid if: All intermediate nodes on the path are online. The total recovery cost of all edges on the path does not exceed k . For each valid path, define its score as the minimum edge‑cost along that path. Return the maximum path score (i.e., the largest minimum -edge cost) among all valid paths. If no valid path exists, return -1. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: edges = [[0,1,5],[1,3,10],[0,2,3],[2,3,4]], online = [true,true,true,true], k = 10 Output: 3 Explanation: The graph has two possible routes from node 0 to node 3: Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3 Total cost = 5 + 10 = 15 , which exceeds k ( 15 &gt; 10 ), so this path is invalid. Path 0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 Total cost = 3 + 4 = 7 &lt;= k , so this path is valid. The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(3, 4) = 3 . There are no other valid paths. Hence, the maximum among all valid path‐scores is 3. Example 2: Input: edges = [[0,1,7],[1,4,5],[0,2,6],[2,3,6],[3,4,2],[2,4,6]], online = [true,true,true,false,true], k = 12 Output: 6 Explanation: Node 3 is offline, so any path passing through 3 is invalid. Consider the remaining routes from 0 to 4: Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 4 Total cost = 7 + 5 = 12 &lt;= k , so this path is valid. The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(7, 5) = 5 . Path 0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 4 Node 3 is offline, so this path is invalid regardless of cost. Path 0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4 Total cost = 6 + 6 = 12 &lt;= k , so this path is valid. The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(6, 6) = 6 . Among the two valid paths, their scores are 5 and 6.

    "description": "You are given an integer n and an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 . This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1 , where edges[i] = [u i , v i ] indicates an edge from node u i to v i . Each node i has an associated cost given by cost[i] , representing the cost to traverse that node. The score of a path is defined as the sum of the costs of all nodes along the path. Your goal is to make the scores of all root-to-leaf paths equal by increasing the cost of any number of nodes by any non-negative amount. Return the minimum number of nodes whose cost must be increased to make all root-to-leaf path scores equal. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], cost = [2,1,3] Output: 1 Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths: Path 0 &rarr; 1 has a score of 2 + 1 = 3 . Path 0 &rarr; 2 has a score of 2 + 3 = 5 . To make all root-to-leaf path scores equal to 5, increase the cost of node 1 by 2. Only one node is increased, so the output is 1. Example 2: Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], cost = [5,1,4] Output: 0 Explanation: There is only one root-to-leaf path: Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 has a score of 5 + 1 + 4 = 10 . Since only one root-to-leaf path exists, all path costs are trivially equal, and the output is 0. Example 3: Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]], cost = [3,4,1,1,7] Output: 1 Explanation: There are three root-to-leaf paths: Path 0 &rarr; 4 has a score of 3 + 7 = 10 . Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 has a score of 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 . Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3 has a score of 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 . To make all root-to-leaf path scores equal to 10, increase the cost of node 1 by 2.

Your task is to find the minimum time t such that after removing all edges with time &lt;= t , the graph contains at least k connected components. Return the minimum time t .

    "description": "You are given n individuals at a base camp who need to cross a river to reach a destination using a single boat. The boat can carry at most k people at a time. The trip is affected by environmental conditions that vary cyclically over m stages. Each stage j has a speed multiplier mul[j] : If mul[j] &gt; 1 , the trip slows down. If mul[j] &lt; 1 , the trip speeds up. Each individual i has a rowing strength represented by time[i] , the time (in minutes) it takes them to cross alone in neutral conditions. Rules: A group g departing at stage j takes time equal to the maximum time[i] among its members, multiplied by mul[j] minutes to reach the destination. After the group crosses the river in time d , the stage advances by floor(d) % m steps. If individuals are left behind, one person must return with the boat. Let r be the index of the returning person, the return takes time[r] &times; mul[current_stage] , defined as return_time , and the stage advances by floor(return_time) % m . Return the minimum total time required to transport all individuals. If it is not possible to transport all individuals to the destination, return -1 . &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 1, k = 1, m = 2, time = [5], mul = [1.0,1.3] Output: 5.00000 Explanation: Individual 0 departs from stage 0, so crossing time = 5 &times; 1.00 = 5.00 minutes. All team members are now at the destination. Thus, the total time taken is 5.00 minutes. Example 2: Input: n = 3, k = 2, m = 3, time = [2,5,8], mul = [1.0,1.5,0.75] Output: 14.50000 Explanation: The optimal strategy is: Send individuals 0 and 2 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 8) &times; mul[0] = 8 &times; 1.00 = 8.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(8.00) % 3 = 2 , so the next stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2 . Individual 0 returns alone from the destination to the base camp from stage 2. The return time is 2 &times; mul[2] = 2 &times; 0.75 = 1.50 minutes. The stage advances by floor(1.50) % 3 = 1 , so the next stage is (2 + 1) % 3 = 0 . Send individuals 0 and 1 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 5) &times; mul[0] = 5 &times; 1.00 = 5.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(5.00) % 3 = 2 , so the final stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2 . All team members are now at the destination. The total time taken is 8.00 + 1.50 + 5.00 = 14.50 minutes. Example 3: Input: n = 2, k = 1, m = 2, time = [10,10], mul = [2.0,2.0] Output: -1.00000 Explanation: Since the boat can only carry one person at a time, it is impossible to transport both individuals as one must always return. Thus, the answer is -1.00 . &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= n == time.length &lt;= 12 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 5 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 5 1 &lt;= time[i] &lt;= 100 m == mul.length 0.5 &lt;= mul[i] &lt;= 2.0",

In each operation, you can choose one element in the array and double its value. Each element can be doubled at most once. The score of a contiguous subarray is defined as the product of its length and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all its elements. Your task is to return the maximum score that can be achieved by selecting a contiguous subarray from the modified array. Note: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [2,4], k = 1 Output: 8 Explanation: Double nums[0] to 4 using one operation.

    "description": "You are given an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 . Each node i has an integer value vals[i] , and its parent is given by par[i] . A subset of nodes within the subtree of a node is called good if every digit from 0 to 9 appears at most once in the decimal representation of the values of the selected nodes. The score of a good subset is the sum of the values of its nodes. Define an array maxScore of length n , where maxScore[u] represents the maximum possible sum of values of a good subset of nodes that belong to the subtree rooted at node u , including u itself and all its descendants. Return the sum of all values in maxScore . Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . &nbsp; Example 1: Input: vals = [2,3], par = [-1,0] Output: 8 Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 0 includes nodes {0, 1} . The subset {2, 3} is good as the digits 2 and 3 appear only once. The score of this subset is 2 + 3 = 5 . The subtree rooted at node 1 includes only node {1} . The subset {3} is good. The score of this subset is 3. The maxScore array is [5, 3] , and the sum of all values in maxScore is 5 + 3 = 8 . Thus, the answer is 8. Example 2: Input: vals = [1,5,2], par = [-1,0,0] Output: 15 Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 0 includes nodes {0, 1, 2} . The subset {1, 5, 2} is good as the digits 1, 5 and 2 appear only once. The score of this subset is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 . The subtree rooted at node 1 includes only node {1} . The subset {5} is good. The score of this subset is 5. The subtree rooted at node 2 includes only node {2} . The subset {2} is good. The score of this subset is 2. The maxScore array is [8, 5, 2] , and the sum of all values in maxScore is 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 . Thus, the answer is 15. Example 3: Input: vals = [34,1,2], par = [-1,0,1] Output: 42 Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 0 includes nodes {0, 1, 2} . The subset {34, 1, 2} is good as the digits 3, 4, 1 and 2 appear only once. The score of this subset is 34 + 1 + 2 = 37 . The subtree rooted at node 1 includes node {1, 2} . The subset {1, 2} is good as the digits 1 and 2 appear only once. The score of this subset is 1 + 2 = 3 . The subtree rooted at node 2 includes only node {2} . The subset {2} is good. The score of this subset is 2. The maxScore array is [37, 3, 2] , and the sum of all values in maxScore is 37 + 3 + 2 = 42 . Thus, the answer is 42. Example 4: Input: vals = [3,22,5], par = [-1,0,1] Output: 18 Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 0 includes nodes {0, 1, 2} . The subset {3, 22, 5} is not good, as digit 2 appears twice. Therefore, the subset {3, 5} is valid. The score of this subset is 3 + 5 = 8 . The subtree rooted at node 1 includes nodes {1, 2} . The subset {22, 5} is not good, as digit 2 appears twice. Therefore, the subset {5} is valid. The score of this subset is 5. The subtree rooted at node 2 includes {2} . The subset {5} is good. The score of this subset is 5. The maxScore array is [8, 5, 5] , and the sum of all values in maxScore is 8 + 5 + 5 = 18 . Thus, the answer is 18. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= n == vals.length &lt;= 500 1 &lt;= vals[i] &lt;= 10 9 par.length == n par[0] == -1 0 &lt;= par[i] &lt; n for i in [1, n - 1] The input is generated such that the parent array par represents a valid tree.",

    "description": "You are given an integer c representing c power stations, each with a unique identifier id from 1 to c (1‑based indexing). These stations are interconnected via n bidirectional cables, represented by a 2D array connections , where each element connections[i] = [u i , v i ] indicates a connection between station u i and station v i . Stations that are directly or indirectly connected form a power grid . Initially, all stations are online (operational). You are also given a 2D array queries , where each query is one of the following two types: [1, x] : A maintenance check is requested for station x . If station x is online, it resolves the check by itself. If station x is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id in the same power grid as x . If no operational station exists in that grid, return -1. [2, x] : Station x goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational). Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type [1, x] in the order they appear. Note: The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking it offline does not alter connectivity. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]] Output: [3,2,3] Explanation: Initially, all stations {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are online and form a single power grid. Query [1,3] : Station 3 is online, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 3. Query [2,1] : Station 1 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {2, 3, 4, 5} . Query [1,1] : Station 1 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {2, 3, 4, 5} , which is station 2. Query [2,2] : Station 2 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {3, 4, 5} . Query [1,2] : Station 2 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {3, 4, 5} , which is station 3. Example 2: Input: c = 3, connections = [], queries = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]] Output: [1,-1] Explanation: There are no connections, so each station is its own isolated grid. Query [1,1] : Station 1 is online in its isolated grid, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 1. Query [2,1] : Station 1 goes offline. Query [1,1] : Station 1 is offline and there are no other stations in its grid, so the result is -1. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= c &lt;= 10 5 0 &lt;= n == connections.length &lt;= min(10 5 , c * (c - 1) / 2) connections[i].length == 2 1 &lt;= u i , v i &lt;= c u i != v i 1 &lt;= queries.length &lt;= 2 * 10 5 queries[i].length == 2 queries[i][0] is either 1 or 2. 1 &lt;= queries[i][1] &lt;= c",

Only this step persists for the rest of the queries. Remove the prefix nums[0..(start i - 1)] (where nums[0..(-1)] will be used to represent the empty prefix). Return an array result of size queries.length where result[i] is the answer for the i th query. A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it. A suffix of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array. Note that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be empty . Note that x-value has a different definition in this version. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3, queries = [[2,2,0,2],[3,3,3,0],[0,1,0,1]] Output: [2,2,2] Explanation: For query 0, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] , and the empty prefix must be removed. The possible operations are: Remove the suffix [2, 4, 5] . nums becomes [1, 2] . Remove the empty suffix. nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] with a product 80, which gives remainder 2 when divided by 3. For query 1, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 3, 5] , and the prefix [1, 2, 2] must be removed. The possible operations are: Remove the empty suffix. nums becomes [3, 5] . Remove the suffix [5] . nums becomes [3] . For query 2, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 3, 5] , and the empty prefix must be removed. The possible operations are: Remove the suffix [2, 2, 3, 5] . nums becomes [1] . Remove the suffix [3, 5] . nums becomes [1, 2, 2] . Example 2: Input: nums = [1,2,4,8,16,32], k = 4, queries = [[0,2,0,2],[0,2,0,1]] Output: [1,0] Explanation: For query 0, nums becomes [2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32] . The only possible operation is: Remove the suffix [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] . For query 1, nums becomes [2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32] . There is no possible way to perform the operation.

Each data packet consists of the following attributes: source : A unique identifier for the machine that generated the packet. destination : A unique identifier for the target machine. timestamp : The time at which the packet arrived at the router. Implement the Router class: Router(int memoryLimit) : Initializes the Router object with a fixed memory limit. memoryLimit is the maximum number of packets the router can store at any given time. If adding a new packet would exceed this limit, the oldest packet must be removed to free up space. bool addPacket(int source, int destination, int timestamp) : Adds a packet with the given attributes to the router. A packet is considered a duplicate if another packet with the same source , destination , and timestamp already exists in the router. Return true if the packet is successfully added (i.e., it is not a duplicate); otherwise return false . int[] forwardPacket() : Forwards the next packet in FIFO (First In First Out) order. Remove the packet from storage. Return the packet as an array [source, destination, timestamp] . If there are no packets to forward, return an empty array. int getCount(int destination, int startTime, int endTime) : Returns the number of packets currently stored in the router (i.e., not yet forwarded) that have the specified destination and have timestamps in the inclusive range [startTime, endTime] .

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [3, -2, 1, 4], l = 2, r = 3 Output: 1 Explanation: The subarrays of length between l = 2 and r = 3 where the sum is greater than 0 are: [3, -2] with a sum of 1 [1, 4] with a sum of 5 [3, -2, 1] with a sum of 2 [-2, 1, 4] with a sum of 3 Out of these, the subarray [3, -2] has a sum of 1, which is the smallest positive sum. Hence, the answer is 1. Example 2: Input: nums = [-2, 2, -3, 1], l = 2, r = 3 Output: -1 Explanation: There is no subarray of length between l and r that has a sum greater than 0. So, the answer is -1. Example 3: Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], l = 2, r = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: The subarray [1, 2] has a length of 2 and the minimum sum greater than 0. So, the answer is 3. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100 1 &lt;= l &lt;= r &lt;= nums.length -1000 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 1000",

    "description": "You are given a string initialCurrency , and you start with 1.0 of initialCurrency . You are also given four arrays with currency pairs (strings) and rates (real numbers): pairs1[i] = [startCurrency i , targetCurrency i ] denotes that you can convert from startCurrency i to targetCurrency i at a rate of rates1[i] on day 1 . pairs2[i] = [startCurrency i , targetCurrency i ] denotes that you can convert from startCurrency i to targetCurrency i at a rate of rates2[i] on day 2 . Also, each targetCurrency can be converted back to its corresponding startCurrency at a rate of 1 / rate . You can perform any number of conversions, including zero , using rates1 on day 1, followed by any number of additional conversions, including zero , using rates2 on day 2. Return the maximum amount of initialCurrency you can have after performing any number of conversions on both days in order . Note: Conversion rates are valid, and there will be no contradictions in the rates for either day. The rates for the days are independent of each other. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: initialCurrency = &quot;EUR&quot;, pairs1 = [[&quot;EUR&quot;,&quot;USD&quot;],[&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;JPY&quot;]], rates1 = [2.0,3.0], pairs2 = [[&quot;JPY&quot;,&quot;USD&quot;],[&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;CHF&quot;],[&quot;CHF&quot;,&quot;EUR&quot;]], rates2 = [4.0,5.0,6.0] Output: 720.00000 Explanation: To get the maximum amount of EUR , starting with 1.0 EUR : On Day 1: Convert EUR to USD to get 2.0 USD . Convert USD to JPY to get 6.0 JPY . On Day 2: Convert JPY to USD to get 24.0 USD . Convert USD to CHF to get 120.0 CHF . Finally, convert CHF to EUR to get 720.0 EUR . Example 2: Input: initialCurrency = &quot;NGN&quot;, pairs1 = [[&quot;NGN&quot;,&quot;EUR&quot;]] , rates1 = [9.0] , pairs2 = [[&quot;NGN&quot;,&quot;EUR&quot;]] , rates2 = [6.0] Output: 1.50000 Explanation: Converting NGN to EUR on day 1 and EUR to NGN using the inverse rate on day 2 gives the maximum amount. Example 3: Input: initialCurrency = &quot;USD&quot;, pairs1 = [[&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;EUR&quot;]], rates1 = [1.0], pairs2 = [[&quot;EUR&quot;,&quot;JPY&quot;]], rates2 = [10.0] Output: 1.00000 Explanation: In this example, there is no need to make any conversions on either day. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= initialCurrency.length &lt;= 3 initialCurrency consists only of uppercase English letters. 1 &lt;= n == pairs1.length &lt;= 10 1 &lt;= m == pairs2.length &lt;= 10 pairs1[i] == [startCurrency i , targetCurrency i ] pairs2[i] == [startCurrency i , targetCurrency i ] 1 &lt;= startCurrency i .length, targetCurrency i .length &lt;= 3 startCurrency i and targetCurrency i consist only of uppercase English letters. rates1.length == n rates2.length == m 1.0 &lt;= rates1[i], rates2[i] &lt;= 10.0 The input is generated such that there are no contradictions or cycles in the conversion graphs for either day.

For each query queries[i] , you need to find the element at index queries[i] in gcdPairs . Return an integer array answer , where answer[i] is the value at gcdPairs[queries[i]] for each query. The term gcd(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b . &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [2,3,4], queries = [0,2,2] Output: [1,2,2] Explanation: gcdPairs = [gcd(nums[0], nums[1]), gcd(nums[0], nums[2]), gcd(nums[1], nums[2])] = [1, 2, 1] . After sorting in ascending order, gcdPairs = [1, 1, 2] . So, the answer is [gcdPairs[queries[0]], gcdPairs[queries[1]], gcdPairs[queries[2]]] = [1, 2, 2] .

Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player&#39;s turn: The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves . Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves. In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them . Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

Return the maximum total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play optimally .

    "description": "You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain. You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds . The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i : To decrease the mountain&#39;s height by x , it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example: To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds. To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on. Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1] Output: 3 Explanation: One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is: Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds. Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second. Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds. Example 2: Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4] Output: 12 Explanation: Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds. Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds. Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds. The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds. Example 3: Input: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1] Output: 15 Explanation: There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15 . &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= mountainHeight &lt;= 10 5 1 &lt;= workerTimes.length &lt;= 10 4 1 &lt;= workerTimes[i] &lt;= 10 6",

    "description": "You are given an integer array nums with length n . The cost of a subarray nums[l..r] , where 0 &lt;= l &lt;= r &lt; n , is defined as: cost(l, r) = nums[l] - nums[l + 1] + ... + nums[r] * (&minus;1) r &minus; l Your task is to split nums into subarrays such that the total cost of the subarrays is maximized , ensuring each element belongs to exactly one subarray. Formally, if nums is split into k subarrays, where k &gt; 1 , at indices i 1 , i 2 , ..., i k &minus; 1 , where 0 &lt;= i 1 &lt; i 2 &lt; ... &lt; i k - 1 &lt; n - 1 , then the total cost will be: cost(0, i 1 ) + cost(i 1 + 1, i 2 ) + ... + cost(i k &minus; 1 + 1, n &minus; 1) Return an integer denoting the maximum total cost of the subarrays after splitting the array optimally. Note: If nums is not split into subarrays, i.e. k = 1 , the total cost is simply cost(0, n - 1) . &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [1,-2,3,4] Output: 10 Explanation: One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -2, 3, 4] into subarrays [1, -2, 3] and [4] . The total cost will be (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 = 10 . Example 2: Input: nums = [1,-1,1,-1] Output: 4 Explanation: One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -1, 1, -1] into subarrays [1, -1] and [1, -1] . The total cost will be (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4 . Example 3: Input: nums = [0] Output: 0 Explanation: We cannot split the array further, so the answer is 0.

    "description": "You are given two positive integers n and k . There are n children numbered from 0 to n - 1 standing in a queue in order from left to right. Initially, child 0 holds a ball and the direction of passing the ball is towards the right direction. After each second, the child holding the ball passes it to the child next to them. Once the ball reaches either end of the line, i.e. child 0 or child n - 1 , the direction of passing is reversed . Return the number of the child who receives the ball after k seconds. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 3, k = 5 Output: 1 Explanation: Time elapsed Children 0 [ 0 , 1, 2] 1 [0, 1 , 2] 2 [0, 1, 2 ] 3 [0, 1 , 2] 4 [ 0 , 1, 2] 5 [0, 1 , 2] Example 2: Input: n = 5, k = 6 Output: 2 Explanation: Time elapsed Children 0 [ 0 , 1, 2, 3, 4] 1 [0, 1 , 2, 3, 4] 2 [0, 1, 2 , 3, 4] 3 [0, 1, 2, 3 , 4] 4 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] 5 [0, 1, 2, 3 , 4] 6 [0, 1, 2 , 3, 4] Example 3: Input: n = 4, k = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: Time elapsed Children 0 [ 0 , 1, 2, 3] 1 [0, 1 , 2, 3] 2 [0, 1, 2 , 3] &nbsp; Constraints: 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 50 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 50 &nbsp; Note: This question is the same as 2582: Pass the Pillow.",
